#Ilios 3 API Examples

This repository exists as a place for Ilios users to browse, download, and contribute custom code for accessing, adding, and updating data via the [Ilios 3 API](https://github.com/ilios/ilios).

Ilios users, administrators, and developers should feel free to download and build upon the code provided here for their own custom purposes including, but not limited to, the following:

1. Reporting
2. Enrollments
3. Object creation/update/deletion (Programs, Courses, Sessions, Offerings, Users, Larning Materials, etc.)

At the current time, all custom and contributed apps are stored at the top level of this repository, regardless of functionality or programming language, and are named in a way that attempts to make their purpose fairly obvious. The programming language in which they're written is indicated by the extension of the filename itself (eg,'.php','.py',etc.), and their use should be fairly well-documented within the comments of the code.

If you would like to contribute your own code examples to the repository, please feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request!
